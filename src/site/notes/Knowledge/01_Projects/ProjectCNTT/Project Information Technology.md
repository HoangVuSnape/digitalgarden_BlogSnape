# Guiding assistant for Vietnamese university admissions powered by Advanced RAG
The University Admission Assistant is an AI-powered system designed to support admission inquiries for 15 universities in Ho Chi Minh City. The system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to enhance query responses by integrating structured data retrieval with generative AI models. This ensures accurate and context-aware answers to users' admission-related questions.

# Architecture System
This project presents two versions of an agent system, comparing their architecture, tools, and functionalities. The improvements in Version 2 result from extensive testing and experimentation.
#### **Version 1**

The initial system employs an embedding-based approach using recursive splitting and vector search for efficient querying. It includes the following tools:

- **Time**: Provides the current time in Vietnamese.
- **getRetrieval**: Inspired by self-RAG, retrieves relevant information.
- **Websearch**: Conducts web searches for additional insights.
- **getScore**: Converts queries into SQL and returns relevant results based on scoring.

#### **Version 2 (Final Version)**

Significant enhancements were made, including:

- **Semantic Chunking**: Improved data segmentation for better understanding.
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines multiple search strategies for enhanced accuracy.
	- Watch more [Rerank_EmbeddingModel](../../02_Tech_Second_Brain/AI_Core/NLP/Rerank_EmbeddingModel.md)
	- 
**Updated Tools:**

- **Time**: Retained from Version 1.
- **Corrective_RAG**: A new tool that routes queries through three channels:
    - **Retrieval**: Fetches relevant information. 
    - **SQL**: Queries structured data.
    - **Websearch**: Performs web searches for external data.

The Corrective_RAG tool optimizes query routing for more efficient and accurate responses.

# Getting started

To get starte with this project, we need to do the following

Config all api key in .env.example(Qdrant, Tavily, GROQ, GEMINAI, LANGCHAIN SMITH)

## Note:  

The reason for using two Qdrant APIs is that one is used for storing the database with recursive chunking, while the other is used for semantic chunking.  

Additionally, during development, you can experiment with the free $300 Google Cloud Console credits to obtain API keys.  

- While configuring, I also use **LLM ChatVertexAI**, and the setup involves configuring Google Console and downloading the JSON file. This file is required to load the LLM values for the agent.  

You can refer to the following link for a guide on setup and credential creation:  
[LangChain Google Vertex AI Setup](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/google_vertex_ai_palm/)

Or you can see step by step to get file creadiential json in this below:
Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project
- Go to Google Cloud Console.
- Click on "Select a project" (or "Create Project" if you don’t have one).
- Enter a Project Name and click "Create".

Step 2: Enable Vertex AI API
- In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to APIs & Services → Library.
- Search for "Vertex AI API".
- Click Enable.

Step 3: Create a Service Account
- Go to APIs & Services → Credentials.
- Click "Create Credentials" → "Service account".
- Enter a Name, ID, and Description, then click Create.
- Assign the Vertex AI User and Editor roles (or a custom role with sufficient permissions).
- Click Done.

Step 4: Generate and Download the JSON Key
- In the Credentials section, find the newly created Service Account.
- Click on it → Navigate to the Keys tab.
- Click "Add Key" → "Create new key".
- Select "JSON" format and click "Create".
- A JSON file will be downloaded to your system (e.g., tdtuchat-16614553b756.json).

Step 5: 
- Rename file json in 2 files python gemi_agent_v1.py, gemi_agent_v2.py correctively

-----------------------

## Run local 

### Prepare enviroment 
Install all dependencies dedicated to the project in local

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After configuring all JSON files, setting up all API keys in the `.env` file, and installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`, follow these steps to run the system:

1. Open Terminal  
2. Activate Virtual Environment  
   - Using **venv**:  
     ```sh
     source .venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows 
     ```

3. Navigate to the Project Folder
   ```sh
   cd UNI_ADMISSIONS_ASSISTANT/src
   ```
4. Run the Application
   ```sh
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

This will start the University Admission Assistant system, which will be accessible in your browser via the Streamlit interface. 🚀
# Evaluate

In this experiment, we compare the performance of two information retrieval methods, Navie RAG and Hybrid Search, when using the chunking methodology with recursive splitting. The two models are evaluated on prominent assessment measures such as Precision@k (P@k), Recall@k, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@k), Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG@k), and Normalized DCG (NDCG@k), with k = 3 and k = 5, respectively.

## **Evaluation Using RAGAS**

To evaluate the system, we tested two versions: **Self-RAG (Version 1)** and **Corrective-RAG (Version 2)**. LangChain Smith was also used to assess workflow performance and processing times.

| Metric                  | Self-RAG (Version 1) | Corrective-RAG (Version 2) |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Faithfulness**        | 0.7241               | 0.834                      |
| **Answer Relevancy**    | 0.7161               | 0.666                      |
| **Context Recall**      | 0.3113               | 0.504                      |
| **Context Precision**   | 0.4167               | 0.571                      |
| **Semantic Similarity** | 0.8835               | 0.886                      |
| **Answer Correctness**  | 0.4014               | 0.565                      |

#### **Performance Analysis**

- **Corrective-RAG (Version 2)** shows improved faithfulness, context recall, and answer correctness.
- **Self-RAG (Version 1)** performs slightly better in answer relevancy but struggles with context recall and correctness.

#### **Processing Time Comparison**

- **Self-RAG:** Execution times range from **5.64 to 11.84 seconds**, with extreme cases reaching **88+ seconds**, showing high inconsistency.
- **Corrective-RAG:** Execution times vary from **7.66 to 55.31 seconds**, with some stable runs under **10 seconds** and complex queries extending beyond **20 seconds**.

#### **Optimization Considerations**

- **Self-RAG** struggles with complex queries, requiring query optimization and system enhancements for stability.
- **Corrective-RAG** still experiences variability, which could be improved through caching and processing pipeline optimizations.

In conclusion, **Corrective-RAG (Version 2) provides better faithfulness, context handling, and correctness, making it a more reliable choice despite some runtime fluctuations.**
